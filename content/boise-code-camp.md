This **free-to-the-community** event has become Boise’s premier software development technical event. Boise Code Camp offers a full day of technology learning for the best price possible: free! Spend a day improving your game, learning the latest technology and networking with your technical peers.



Code Camp offers open sessions provided by leading technology professionals from Idaho and all over the Northwest! During several time slots during the day, there are six to eight hour-long sessions on various disciplines: from database fundamentals, requirements creation, cloud computing, agile practices, or networking advances. Attendees can choose which sessions to attend. Boise Code Camp provides relevant content for technology practitioners of all levels and interests.

## Code Camp Manifesto

1. **By and For the Technology Community**\
   Code Camps are about the software developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.
2. **Always Free**\
   Code Camps are always free for attendees.
3. **Community Developed Material**\
   The success of Code Camps is that they are based on community content. All delivered content is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction.
4. **No Fluff, only Code**\
   Code Camps are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this.
5. **Community Ownership**\
   The most important element of a Code Camp is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.
6. **Never occur during work hours**\
   We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of Code Camp is that they always occur on weekends.
